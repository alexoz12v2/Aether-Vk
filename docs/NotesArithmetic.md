# Arithmetic notes and Progress of work

## For weeks 2 of work

- Write a core/math module in which we focus on a library which computes the error with interval
  arithmetic for any arithmetic expression on floating point and try to traspose it on slang
- Priority on Input Event handling,
- Study how to implement a rudimentary Entity-Component-System (see library if necessary), which
  integrates on our Render Thread/Update Thread/UI Thread framework
- UI Overlay on (imgui)
  - scale 
  - debug statistics
  - manipulate fov from UI
  - switch from Orthographic to Perspective Projection
  - target bounding box of imported model
